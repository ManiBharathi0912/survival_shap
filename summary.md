# Summary

## Key findings
- Model demonstrates reasonable discrimination (C-index) and interpretable feature effects consistent with clinical intuition.
- SHAP highlights dominant drivers (Nodes, Age) and clarifies individual predictions.

## Hypothesis validation
Hypothesis check:
- More positive axillary lymph nodes (Nodes) should increase risk and shorten survival time; SHAP shows a positive contribution trend.
- Older Age generally raises risk; Year of operation may reflect era-of-care effects.
- Low-risk profile shows protective ranges across features; high-risk profile accumulates adverse contributions.
